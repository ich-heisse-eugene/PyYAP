Yet Another Pipeline in Python for echelle data reduction

Further development of PySEX pipeline, originally written by Vadim Krushinsky (Ural Federal University, Ekaterinburg, Russia) for reduction of simple echelle spectra. Compare to the original, this version contains tonnes of improvement, many procedures were written from scratch. For correct using, the pipeline requires Python v3.8+ and the following modules:
- internal (sys, os, warnings, math, shutil, datetime, types, datetime, types, time, copy, logging).
- external (astropy, numpy (<2), matplotlib, scipy, scikit-image, sklearn, astroquery, argparse).

The current version of the pipeline is designed for reduction of echelle spectra coming from the Medium Resolution Echelle Spectrograph (MRES) of the 2.4-m Thai National Telescope and eShel spectrographs installed on the NARIT telescopes in Chachoengsao, Korat and Doi Inthanon (Thailand). The package was independently tested on machines running Debian Linux Sid, macOS Big Sur and Windows 10.

To install the package unpack the archive in the preferred place and set its path in the first line of file reduce4me.py (variable Pkg_path).

Examples of usage:
- lazy regime:
python3  /path/to/the/package/reduce4me.py /current/work/directory/with/FITSfiles 
- advanced regime (extract data using APEX algorithm with the subtraction of scattered and without removing of temporary files):
python3  /path/to/the/package/reduce4me.py /current/work/directory/with/FITSfiles --device mres --method APEX --sl True --strip False

To get help run this:
python3  /path/to/the/package/reduce4me.py /current/work/directory/with/FITSfiles  --help

Warning:
1. By default the package is configured for work with data from MRES in the observing season 2021/2022
2. Before the first run it is mandatory to create in the directory with FITS-files an ASCII file names.txt of the following format:

name-of-bias-file.fits   ;  Bias

name-of-flat-file.fits   ;  Flat

name-of-obj-file.fits   ;  HD 92554*

name-of-arc-file.fits   ; ThAr


*Objects' names must be recognizable by Simbad

The minimum set of types must include bias, fits, object, thar
