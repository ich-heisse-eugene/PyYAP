# if s_ordim_method == 'hybrid' then the average of objects+flat is used to determine and trace the orders. Alternatively, 'objects' or 'flats' can be used for tracing. If the location of the orders is known and relatively stable, s_ordim_method='remap' must be used. In this case, the algorithm adjusts the existing map of orders to the current setup using flats, while the FWHM of individual orders remains fixed to the existing mask.
